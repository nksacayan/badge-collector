Setup frontend proxy to hit backend 


---
Use token-based auth and avoid cookies so i can avoid https

‚úÖ Party-safe setup (no HTTPS, no CA installs)
Here‚Äôs how to make it work cleanly across all LAN devices:
üîê Use token-based auth
- Issue a short-lived token from the backend (e.g., /api/login)
- Store it in memory or localStorage
- Send it in the Authorization header:
fetch('/api/user', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  credentials: 'omit'
});


üß≠ Use Vite proxy for same-origin dev
- Proxy /api to Spring Boot so frontend and backend appear same-origin
- No CORS issues, no cookie weirdness
üåê Serve frontend from Windows LAN IP
- Vite config:
server: {
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000,
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
  },
}


- Access from mobile: http://192.168.1.69:3000
üß™ Backend CORS config
Spring Boot:
.allowedOriginPatterns("http://192.168.*.*")
.allowCredentials(false) // since you're not using cookies



üéâ Party-proof checklist
- ‚úÖ No HTTPS needed
- ‚úÖ No CA installs
- ‚úÖ No cookies required
- ‚úÖ Works on any LAN device with a browser
- ‚úÖ Easy to reset or rotate tokens if needed

For NFC token:

üß© Options to inject identity into NFC-triggered requests
‚úÖ Option 1: Use a frontend redirector
NFC tag points to frontend, not backend:
http://192.168.1.69:3000/scan?badgeId=XYZ123


Your frontend:
- Reads badgeId from the URL
- Checks if the user is logged in (token in memory or localStorage)
- Sends a fetch to the backend with Authorization: Bearer <token> and badgeId
This way, the browser injects the token because it‚Äôs running your app.
Pros:
- Works with your existing token-based auth
- No need to modify NFC tags later
- You control the UX (can show feedback, errors, etc.)
Cons:
- Requires users to be logged in before scanning
- If they scan from outside your app, it won‚Äôt work

üîß Why JWT Wins for Your Use Case
You're building a LAN-hosted party site with:
- React frontend that needs to know who's logged in
- NFC-triggered endpoints that must include user identity
- No serious security concerns (so token storage in localStorage is fine)
- A desire for modular, reusable patterns
JWT is the ergonomic choice because:
- You can embed user info directly in the token (sub, name, role, etc.).
- React can decode the token without extra API calls.
- NFC scans can hit endpoints with Authorization: Bearer <token> ‚Äî no session context needed.
- You avoid session store complexity and scale cleanly even if you expand later.

üöÄ How JWT Works in Your App
- Login: User logs in via React frontend.
- Token Issued: Spring Boot backend generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
- Storage: Client stores the token (e.g., in memory or localStorage).
- Authenticated Requests: Client includes the token in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
- Validation: Backend verifies the token signature and extracts user info.

‚úÖ Benefits for Your Use Case
- Stateless: No need to store sessions server-side‚Äîgreat for LAN.
- Fast: Token validation is quick and scalable.
- Secure Identity Transfer: NFC-triggered requests can include the JWT to identify the user.
- Portable: Can be passed via headers, cookies, or even URLs (Base64Url-encoded)

‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For
- Token Expiry: Use short-lived tokens with exp claim.
- Revocation: JWTs are hard to revoke unless you track them (e.g., with a blacklist).
- Storage Risks: Avoid storing tokens in localStorage if XSS is a concern‚Äîconsider httpOnly cookies.

üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices
- Use Spring Security with a JWT filter to validate tokens.
- In React, manage token lifecycle with a custom hook or context.
- Consider refresh tokens for longer sessions.

Want a validator-style JWT filter for Spring Boot or a React hook to manage tokens? I can sketch one out for you.
